# DeepMIMODetection

This repository holds 2 files.

The first one is the FullyConnected architecture used to detect over a fixed channel (in this specific case we detect over a 0.6-Toeplitz channel where K=20 N=30. CSV file with the channel also found in this repo).

The second one is the DetNet architecture as described in the paper "Deep MIMO Detection" presented at SPAWC 2017. Detection is over I.I.D gaussian random channels.
